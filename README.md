# About This Project

This project introduces an innovative conceptual framework called the Noise Adaptive Algorithm, a method for protecting digital images and videos from unauthorized use and manipulation by AI generative models (such as those used for deepfakes, AI-driven content generation, or training data extraction). The core principle is to achieve this protection without degrading the visual quality for human perception.

With the rapid advancements in generative AI (like Google's Veo and similar technologies), the need to protect personal photos, artistic creations, and sensitive visual data is more urgent than ever. This project aims to contribute a novel approach towards responsible AI usage and data protection, striking a balance between leveraging AI for beneficial purposes and safeguarding against its misuse. The core of this algorithm features a unique, dynamic, and layered protective structure, briefly introduced below and detailed further in separate dedicated repositories.

# Key Features

### a.  Intelligent Noise Embedding (via Adaptive Spider Web):
The algorithm embeds a specially structured adaptive noise. This noise forms a sophisticated, multi-layered, and dynamic "Adaptive Spider Web" (Jaring Laba-Laba Adaptif) pattern, imperceptible to humans but designed to disrupt AI processes.

### b.  AI Recognition Toggle (User Control):
Users can conceptually choose whether their image output is "AI-Friendly" (for beneficial AI uses) or "Protected" (with the adaptive noise applied).

### c.  Human-Friendly Output:
The protection is designed to be imperceptible to human vision, with no visible watermarks or distortions, preserving the original image quality.

### d.  Screenshot Resilience (Conceptual):
As the protective noise is embedded within the pixel data, it is intended to remain effective even if the image is screenshotted.

## Core Innovation:

The "Adaptive Spider Web" Concept (Brief Overview)
The "Noise Adaptive Algorithm" achieves its protection through a unique, imperceptible "Adaptive Spider Web" structure. This is not random noise but a dynamically generated, multi-layered mesh that is:

Centered on detected human subjects.
Flexibly adapts its form based on the subject's position relative to the image frame.
Designed to make AI-generated outputs fail or become illogical.
Provides tamper-evidence if the web's structure is broken.
A comprehensive explanation of the "Adaptive Spider Web" concept, including its layered architecture, dynamic behavior, handling of multiple subjects, secondary object protection, and the conceptual verification application, can be found in the following dedicated repositories:

Public Disclosure & Intent
This project and its concepts are publicly disclosed on GitHub by Rijal Saepuloh as of May 2025. The primary purpose of this public disclosure is to establish prior art and to share these ideas with the broader community. This is done with the intent to foster discussion, further research, and potential development towards responsible AI, especially given the current limitations in pursuing formal patent protection.
